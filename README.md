## About the Project


The S&P 500 Index is the most followed stock market index, probably because it is one of the oldest stock market indexes, having started in 1957. More explanation of the index can be found [Here](https://stockmarketmba.com/whatisthesp500index.php)

For this project I used beautifulsoup and pandas packages to webscrape the data from the website that contains information about the stocks of 500 US based companies. The link can be found [here](https://stockmarketmba.com/stocksinthesp500.php) as well as in my python file.
