## About the Project


The S&P 500 Index is the most followed stock market index, probably because it is one of the oldest stock market indexes, having started in 1957. More explanation of the index can be found [Here](https://stockmarketmba.com/whatisthesp500index.php)

For this project I used beautifulsoup and pandas packages to webscrape the data from the website that contains information about the stocks of 500 US based companies. The link can be found [here](https://stockmarketmba.com/stocksinthesp500.php), as well as in my python file.

### The tables contains 10 variables:
1. Symbol of the stock
2. Description (Name of the Company)
3. Category of the stock (stock, fund etc)
4. Category (Large cap)
5. GICS Sector (Company Sector)
6. Market Cap (The total value of all a company's shares of stock)
7. Dividend yield
8. Price To TTM Earnings (Price Earning or P/E ratio. On Average value investors look at 20 - 25 P/E ratio range)
9. Price To TTM Sales (Price to Sales or PS ratio. The share price of a company divided by its sales per share. PS ration is typically good when the value falls between one and two. A price-to-sales ratio with a value less than one is better.)
10. Price to Book Value (P/B Value tells investors whether a company's stock price is valued properly. Usually, if the value is  under 1.0, then it is considered a good P/B for value investors, indicating that a stock can be potentially undervalued. Investors may often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0 as their benchmark.
